# gominer

gominer is an application for performing Proof-of-Work (PoW) mining on the
Decred network after the activation of DCP0011 using BLAKE3.  It supports solo
and stratum/pool mining using OpenCL devices.

## Downloading

Binaries are not currently available.  See the [Building](#building)
([Windows](#windows), [Linux](#linux)) section for details on how to build
`gominer` from source.

## Configuring `gominer`

`gominer` needs to acquire work in order to have something to solve.  Currently, the only supported method is solo mining via a `dcrd` RPC server.  There are plans to support [dcrpool](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool) for pooled mining in the future.

In order to communicate with the `dcrd` RPC server, `gominer` must be configured
with `dcrd`'s RPC server credentials.

- Obtain the RPC username and password by finding the `rpcuser` and `rpcpass`
  entries in the `dcrd.conf` file
  - Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Dcrd\dcrd.conf`
  - Linux: `~/.dcrd/dcrd.conf`
  - MacOs: `~/Library/Application Support/Dcrd/dcrd.conf`
- Create a `gominer.conf` file at the platform-specific path that contains the
  **exact same** `rpcuser=` and `rpcpass=` lines you obtained from the
  `dcrd.conf` file in the previous step
  - Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Gominer\gominer.conf`
  - Linux: `~/.gominer/gominer.conf`
  - MacOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Gominer/gominer.conf`
  - The `gominer.conf` config file should have at least the following lines:
  ```
  rpcuser=<same rpcuser from dcrd.conf>
  rpcpass=<same rpcpass from dcrd.conf>
  ```

Next, `dcrd` must be configured with a mining address to send the payment for
mined blocks.  That is accomplished by either launching `dcrd` with the
`--miningaddr=Ds...` CLI flag or adding a `miningaddr=Ds...` to the
aforementioned `dcrd.conf` file and restarting `dcrd`.

## Running

### Benchmark mode

`gominer` provides a benchmark mode where no work is submitted in order to test
your setup.

```
./gominer -B
```

### Solo Mining on Mainnet

Ensure you have [configured](#configuring-gominer) `gominer` with `dcrd`'s RPC
credentials as well as `dcrd` with a `miningaddr`.  Once the credentials and
mining address have been configured, simply run gominer to begin mining.

```
./gominer
```

## Status API

There is a built-in status API to report miner information. You can set an
address and port with `--apilisten`. There are configuration examples on
[sample-gominer.conf](sample-gominer.conf). If no port is specified, then it
will listen by default on `3333`.

Example usage:

```sh
$ gominer --apilisten="localhost"
```

Example output:

```sh
$ curl http://localhost:3333/
> {
    "validShares": 0,
    "staleShares": 0,
    "invalidShares": 0,
    "totalShares": 0,

## Building

### Linux

#### Preliminaries

Gominer works with both OpenCL (both AMD and NVIDIA) and CUDA (NVIDIA only).
At the current time, most users have reported that OpenCL gives them higher
hashrates on NVIDIA.

**NOTE: Although gominer works with CUDA, there are not any build instructions
yet.  The will be provided at a later date**.

Once you decide on OpenCL or CUDA, you will need to install the
graphics driver for your GPU as well as the headers for OpenCL or CUDA
depending on your choice.

The exact packages are dependent on the specific Linux distribution, but,
generally speaking, you will need the latest AMDGPU-PRO display drivers for
AMD cards and the latest NVIDIA graphics display drivers for NVIDIA cards.

You will also need the OpenCL headers which is typically named something
similar to `mesa-opencl-dev` (for AMD) or `nvidia-opencl-dev` (for NVIDIA).

If you're using OpenCL, it is also recommended to install your distribution's
equivalent of the `clinfo` package if you have any issues to ensure your device
can be detected by OpenCL.  When `clinfo` is unable to detect your device,
`gominer` will not be able to either.

The following sections provide instructions for the following combinations:

* [OpenCL for NVIDIA on Ubuntu 23.04](#opencl-with-nvidia-on-ubuntu-2304)
* [OpenCL for AMD on Debian Bookworm](#opencl-with-amd-on-debian-bookworm)

#### OpenCL Build Instructions (Works with Both NVIDIA and AMD)

##### OpenCL Pre-Requisites

- Download and install [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/)
  - Make sure you uncheck `Run MSYS2 now.`
- Launch the `MSYS2 MINGW64` shell from the start menu
  - NOTE: The `MSYS2` installer will launch the `UCRT64` shell by default if
    you didn't uncheck `Run MSYS2 now` as instructed.  That shell will not work,
    so close it if you forgot to uncheck it in the installer.
- From within the `MSYS2 MINGW64` shell enter the following commands to install
  `gcc`, `git`, `go`, `unzip`, the light OpenCL SDK, and the `gominer` source code
  - `pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc mingw-w64-x86_64-tools mingw-w64-x86_64-go git unzip`
